### Project Overview

The **Shaping E-Roads Efficiency for Freight Automation (SEE-FAr)** project investigates innovative solutions for the **electrification and automation of long-haul freight transport**. It combines data-driven analytical models with **agent-based simulation** to assess the technical, economic, and environmental impacts of deploying stationary (plug-in) and dynamic (in-motion electric road) charging infrastructures.

SEE-FAr aims to provide actionable insights into the cost-effectiveness, scalability, and sustainability of different charging strategies, helping stakeholders shape the future of freight logistics in an era of automation and electrification.

### Objectives

- Analyze the operational efficiency of e-road freight systems under automation.  
- Evaluate trade-offs between stationary charging and dynamic charging infrastructures.  
- Quantify **energy consumption, emissions reduction, and system costs**.  
- Identify **policy and planning strategies** to support a sustainable freight transition.  

### Collaboration

SEE-FAr is funded by the **German Research Foundation (DFG)** and is jointly undertaken by an international team of experts in transportation engineering, logistics, and energy systems. At TUM, the project is hosted at the **Chair of Transportation Systems Engineering**, led by **Prof. Dr. Constantinos Antoniou**.

### Role

As a doctoral researcher and research associate, Shahriar Iqbal Zame contributes to the **development of agent-based models, optimization frameworks, and scenario analysis**. The focus lies on understanding behavioral responses, infrastructure utilization, and system-level implications of electrification and automation in freight transport.
