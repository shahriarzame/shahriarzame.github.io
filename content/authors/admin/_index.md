I am a **Research Associate and PhD Candidate** at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Chair of Transportation Systems Engineering, working on the DFG-funded project [SEE-FAr](https://www.mos.ed.tum.de/vvs/forschung/projekte/see-far/).

My research combines **agent-based simulations, optimization, and choice modelling** to explore innovative electrification and automation strategies for road freight. With an **M.Sc. in Transportation Systems (TUM)** and professional experience in large-scale infrastructure projects, I focus on methods that support both **policy design** and **industry decision-making** in sustainable logistics.
