## Course Overview

I recently had the opportunity to attend the short course **"Discrete Choice Analysis: Predicting Individual Behavior and Market Demand"** at **École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland** (January 25–29, 2026), organized by the Transport and Mobility Laboratory (TRANSP-OR).

It was a rigorous and highly applied deep dive into:
- Random utility models
- Nested and mixed logit
- Hybrid choice models
- Bayesian estimation
- Microsimulation
- Forecasting techniques

## Key Highlights

The integration of theory, case studies, and hands-on work with **BIOGEME** made the experience particularly valuable. The course provided a comprehensive foundation in behavioral modeling and demand forecasting that is directly applicable to transportation systems research.

## Acknowledgments

My sincere thanks to **Prof. Moshe Ben-Akiva (MIT)** and **Prof. Michel Bierlaire (EPFL)** for delivering a week of intellectually dense and methodologically precise training. I also thank my supervisor, **Prof. Constantinos Antoniou**, for making this opportunity possible.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to apply these advanced discrete choice modeling tools to:
- Behavioral modeling in transportation
- Demand forecasting
- Transport systems research
- Policy evaluation and scenario analysis
