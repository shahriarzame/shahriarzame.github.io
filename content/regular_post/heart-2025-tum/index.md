### hEART 2025 – An Inspiring Gathering

{{< figure src="heart2025-photo.jpg" alt="hEART 2025 at TUM" >}}

The **13th Symposium of the European Association for Research in Transportation (hEART 2025)** took place in Munich, bringing together an international community of transportation researchers and practitioners. This year’s symposium was co-hosted by the **Chair of Transportation Systems Engineering (TSE)** and the **Chair of Traffic Engineering and Control** at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**.  

As a **doctoral researcher at TUM**, it was both a privilege and an honor to not only attend but also contribute to hosting this high-level conference.  

### Highlights

- Engaged in inspiring keynote lectures by **Prof. Gitta Kutyniok** and **Prof. Hani S. Mahmassani**, with much anticipation for the keynote by **Prof. S. Travis Waller**.  
- Participated in stimulating sessions, posters, and panel discussions showcasing cutting-edge research in **transportation modeling, planning, and policy**.  
- Connected with colleagues and experts from across the globe, reinforcing the collaborative spirit of transportation research.  
- Looked forward to the upcoming **MATSim User Meeting** and **PhD School**, set to extend the momentum of this gathering.  

### Reflections

The symposium was a remarkable experience to be part of both academically and organizationally. It reinforced the importance of international collaboration in addressing the challenges of sustainable, efficient, and equitable transport systems.  

I am grateful to the organizing team, participants, and sponsors for making this conference a success, and proud to have played a role in welcoming the community to Munich.  

Here’s to continuing the dialogue, advancing the science of transportation, and building networks that will shape the future of mobility. 🚀
